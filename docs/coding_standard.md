# Coding Standard

The final decisions of whether code is good enough is up to [MrTreev](https://github.com/MrTreev).

## Never use `using namespace`

## Limit the use of `using` directives to minimal scopes

## Use modern C++ library includes

## No nested ternaries

## Use ISO standard C++ extensions only used when absolutely required

## Failures

Use exceptions to signal a failure to perform a required task
Use std::optional to signal a failure to perform an optional task
